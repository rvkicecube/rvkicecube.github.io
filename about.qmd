## What is Cube Draft?

Cube draft is one of Magic: The Gathering's most beloved and skill-intensive formats. Unlike booster draft where you open random packs, cube draft uses a carefully curated collection of cards (called a "cube") that provides a unique and balanced draft experience every time.

### Key Features of Cube Draft:

- **Singleton Format**: Only one copy of each card in the cube
- **Curated Experience**: Every card is hand-picked for power level and synergy
- **Skill-Testing**: Rewards deep knowledge of Magic and drafting technique
- **Replayable**: The same cube creates different experiences each draft
- **Vintage Cards**: Often includes powerful cards from Magic's history

## Our Story

IceCube Reykjav√≠k was founded by passionate Magic players who wanted to bring the cube draft experience to Iceland. Recognizing the lack of regular cube events in the country, we set out to create a community where players could experience this incredible format.

### Our Vision
