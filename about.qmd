## What is Cube Draft?

Cube draft is one of Magic: The Gathering's most beloved and skill-intensive formats. Unlike booster draft where you open random packs, cube draft uses a carefully curated collection of cards (called a "cube") that provides a unique and balanced draft experience every time.

### Key Features of Cube Draft:

- **Singleton Format**: Only one copy of each card in the cube
- **Curated Experience**: Every card is hand-picked for power level and synergy
- **Skill-Testing**: Rewards deep knowledge of Magic and drafting technique
- **Replayable**: The same cube creates different experiences each draft
- **Vintage Cards**: Often includes powerful cards from Magic's history

## Our Story
