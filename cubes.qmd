## Cube Philosophy

Our cube designs follow core principles that ensure every draft is memorable:

### 🎯 **Balanced Archetypes**
Each cube supports multiple viable strategies across all color combinations, ensuring no single approach dominates the draft environment.

### ⚖️ **Skill Rewarding**
Cards are chosen to reward tight play, deep game knowledge, and strategic thinking while remaining accessible to newer players.

### 🔄 **High Replayability** 
Every draft feels fresh thanks to carefully balanced card interactions and multiple viable paths to victory.

### 🏆 **Tournament Ready**
All cubes are designed with competitive play in mind, providing engaging games that test players' skills fairly.
